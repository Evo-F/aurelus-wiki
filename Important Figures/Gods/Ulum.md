# Summary
Ulum is the **god of Water**, and is chiefly responsible for bringing water to Oloth-2.  It currently resides in the Elemental Plane of Water, as it feels more comfortable in that Plane than other ones.  Surprisingly, Ulum is welcoming to outsiders who enter its domain, so long as they remain peaceful. Ulum has not been observed by a mortal since the end of the Second Era.  Ulum is the patron of Traders, The Sea, and Animals, and holds a particular (if unsurprising) fondness for sea creatures.
