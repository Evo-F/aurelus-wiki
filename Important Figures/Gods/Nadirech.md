# Summary
Nadirech is the **god of Luck and Trickery.** Nadirech prefers a more direct approach to life on Oloth-2, often taking the form of a human or elf for the purposes of trickery.  He is believed by many to have the ability to directly change the amount of “luck” or “skill” one may have in their own life - it has been said that Nadirech has the power to "weight the dice of life." Nadirech continues to be sighted in Oloth-2 regularly, as bettors remain wary of gambling with him.  He is the patron of Deceit, Trickery, and Cowardice.
