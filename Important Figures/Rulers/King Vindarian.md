## Summary
King Vindarian was the last ruler of [[Aurelus]] in the [[Second Era]]. He ruled as a despot with an iron first, and was generally despised by his people. Vindarian was murdered by an elven assassin in 503 SE - there is some debate as to whether this assassin was working alone, in service of an independent organization, or in service to the [[Elven Confederacy]]. His death ushered in the beginning of the [[Third Era]].
