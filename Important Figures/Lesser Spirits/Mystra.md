# Summary
Mystra is the **embodiment of Magic and the Occult.** She taught the creatures of the First Era magic, and she is traditionally worshipped by magic-users. Mystra now resides in the Astral Plane, where some powerful magic users have been able to travel and even speak to her in their dreams.

Though some chose to follow her teachings, many rejected what Mystra had to offer them out of fear, anger, and hysteria. As a result, Mystra has decided to never come to the material plane again, though she still indirectly guides some magic-users to this day.  Mystra is the patron of the Supernatural, Magic, and Innovation.
