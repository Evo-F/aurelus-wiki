## Beginnings
An untold amount of time, presumably millions of years, comprised the First Era.  This Era consisted primarily of direct divine intervention on [[Oloth-2]], with most gods and powerful entities, with the exception of [[Lolth]], making the realm their primary place of habitation besides the Celestial/Infernal Planes.  As species grew and evolved, they created the first settlements on the planet, with the pantheon establishing the different races we observe on Oloth-2 today, from humans to dwarves to orcs and elves.  The only species that was eliminated by the pantheon were pure dragons, for they were viewed by the powerful beings as a “mistake”, and constantly attacked other lifeforms for no particular reason.  
## Ending
The First Era truly ended with the exodus of the gods and entities from the Prime Material Plane, as humanity and other species developed to their modern forms.  The entities would visit the Plane from time to time, with some still frequenting the Plane often, but the pantheon decided to let these new, evolved life forms have free will over their realm.  However, some, like [[Aur]], willingly forbid themselves from physically intervening in the human world anymore, though these reasons are unknown to mortals.  Thus, the First Era ended with this departure, and the [[Second Era]] began.
