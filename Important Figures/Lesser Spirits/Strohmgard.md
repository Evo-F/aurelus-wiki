# Summary
Strohmgard is the **embodiment of War.**  He greatly enjoys battle, but has promised to [[Aur]] that he would not personally intervene with human conflicts.  Instead, he now battles fearsome entities and foes from other planes, and has almost always triumphed in battle.  Strohmgard is revered by human warriors and orcs on account of his strength. Strohmgard is the patron of Battle and Unity - however, historians and students of the mythos surrounding him may find this a strange combination.
