After suffering heavy casualties on both sides, the leaders of the human/dwarf alliance, under the banner of [[Aurelus]], and the [[Elven Confederacy]] agreed to a ceasefire to tend to the wounded and rebuild their respective societies.  However, it is important to note that both parties did not officially agree to a peace treaty in order to officially end the conflict.  As a result, human and elven settlements in both Aurelus and the Elven Confederacy do not trust one another that much.  Both societies will trade with one another for goods and supplies, and will even travel into each others’ territories.  But, acts of discrimination by humans against elves, and elves against humans, remain fairly common in the 173 years since the end of violent conflict.  A majority of humans and elves wish for an official peace treaty and greater cooperation between the two nations against outside threats (orc invasions, drow cults, etc.), with a small minority wishing for both nations to become one unified nation.
