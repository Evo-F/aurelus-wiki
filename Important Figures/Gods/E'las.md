# Summary
E’las is the **god of Wisdom and Mercy**, and the companion to [[Aur]], ensuring that justice is never enacted without consideration to mercy.  Both work together to protect the material plane from threats, while also fostering a hopeful environment for the realm’s inhabitants to grow and evolve on their own free will.  E'las resides in the celestial plane with Aur, though it travels to other planes largely out of curiosity - it does not experience fear, pain, or torment, and thus explores reality of its own volition. E'las is the patron of Exploration, Education, and Curiosity.
