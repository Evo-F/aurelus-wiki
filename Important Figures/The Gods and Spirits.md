In the world of Oloth-2, there are **six** supernatural entities that are generally revered as gods, and **four** similar entities which are considered to be demigods or Lesser Spirits.

## Gods
The six gods are beings of near-absolute cosmic power, with each one being the warden of a particular domain or set of domains. Although worship of these entities may vary according to geographical location, race, and profession, there is a common understanding and acceptance of these five as more supreme beings, having precedence over the Lesser Spirits.

## List of Gods
The six gods of Oloth-2 are:
- [[Aur]], the god of Justice.
- [[E'las]], the god of Wisdom and Mercy, and Aur's companion.
- [[Lolth]], the goddess of Spiders and the Night.
- [[Cindrache'e]], the goddess of Fire and the Home.
- [[Ulum]], the god of Water.
- [[Nadirech]], the god of Luck and Trickery. 

## Lesser Spirits
The four Lesser Spirits are not considered supreme beings, though they do wield substantial power and influence in their attributed domains. The Lesser Spirits are not always considered humanoid or elfoid in nature, but instead usually manifest as embodiments of some force representative of their domain.

## List of Lesser Spirits
The four commonly-known Lesser Spirits of Oloth-2 are:
- [[Les-Zeraiimus]], the embodiment of Discord.
- [[Vitram]], the embodiment of Love.
- [[Mystra]], the embodiment of Magic and the Occult.
