## Beginnings
The departure of the [[First Era]], much to the chagrin of the entities who had faith in these various species, left a massive power gap.  Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, and drow all claimed that they were the rightful rulers of not just the Grand Continent, but all of Oloth-2.  Thus, approximately five hundred years of conflict ensued after the gods’ departure from direct intervention in the Material Realm.  
## Growing Conflict
At first, fighting occurred between villages and small territories, but grew as alliances between races were established during wartime.  The humans and dwarves became allied together, establishing a strong foothold on the Grand Continent in the form of a new nation, [[Aurelus]], in 152 SE (Second Era).  The elves formed their own alliance amongst elven villages and strongholds in the form of the [[Elven Confederacy]].  Finally, the orcs remained outsiders in isolated villages and nomadic tribes, preferring raids and pillages on larger settlements over standard warfare.  By 400 SE, the nation of Aurelus had expanded to over two thirds of the Grand Continent. However, this growth was short-lived, as Aurelus' borders were pushed back over time by orc raids, and later, the Elven Confederacy. 
## Ending
By 500 SE, Aurelus now occupied only a third of the Grand Continent.  The murder of [[King Vindarian]] of Aurelus by an elven assassin in 503 SE prompted the end of the Second Era, and ushered in the beginning of the [[Third Era]]. It should be noted, however, that Vindarian was a despot who ruled over his inhabitants with an iron fist - despite the gruesome nature of his murder, the people of Aurelus were largely glad to see him go.
