# Summary
Les-Zeraiimus is the **embodiment of Discord**, and is the offspring of [[Lolth]] and an unknown entity.  He thrives off of chaos and disorder throughout all of the realms.  Les-Zeraiimus is the most feared of the Lesser Spirits by most races, except for the [[Drow]].  He was last seen in the Prime Material Plane during the [[First Era]], and has been presumed either dead or imprisoned in another plane since.  Les-Zeraiimus is the patron of Thieves, Chaos, and Betrayal.

# Recent Events
Throughout [[Act III]] and [[Act IV]], [[The Party]] began to encounter servants of Les-Zeraiimus in hostile scenarios. These servants appear to represent some kind of cult in worship of Les-Zeraiimus, and the Party's exploits have brought them into direct conflict with this cult.
