# Summary
Vitram is believed by many inhabitants of Oloth-2 to be the force behind Love, and is called upon as a blessing for many marriages.  Vitram is a pacifist entity, but has periodically cursed those who have cheated on or harmed their significant other.  Legends tell of a potion she once brewed that made [[Ulum]] and [[Lolth]] fall in love with each other, though [[Aur]]’s banishment of Lolth to the infernal plane negated its effects.  Vitram is the patron of Marriages, Loyalty, and Karma.
