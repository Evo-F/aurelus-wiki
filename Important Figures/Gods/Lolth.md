# Summary
Lolth is the **goddess of Spiders and the Night.** Lolth was banished to the Infernal Plane by [[Aur]] sometime between the [[Initial Conflict]] and the [[First Era]].  She wishes to conquer all the realms for herself and her spider offspring.  Lolth is currently unable to leave the Infernal Plane, unless a necrotic portal is created between her plane and another plane.  Lolth is also known as the Mistress of Death, and she is the patron of Evil and Pain.
